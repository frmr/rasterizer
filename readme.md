This library renders triangles to buffers that are passed into it. It has the following features:
* Quad-based triangle rasterization
* Multithreaded tiled rendering
* Z-buffer
* Affine and perspective-correct texture mapping
* Texture repeat/clamp
* Bilinear texture filtering
* Backface culling
* Position/normal interpolation
* Triange/strip/fan
* Render to texture
* Depth bias
* Programmable fragment shaders
